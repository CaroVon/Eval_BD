# Pilot results (Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct, GSM8K test, 200-question subset)

Subset: 200 ids drawn with seed 20261028 (`results/data/determinism_subset_ids.json`).
Greedy decoding, Lmax = 1024, A100 80GB PCIe, vLLM 0.32.0 batch-invariant mode.

## 1. Determinism (plan sec 2.2, RQ2)

| Layer | bf16, BI on | bf16, BI off (control) | fp32, BI on |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 repeat run, separate processes | 0/200 differ | 26/200 differ (2 answers) | 0/200 |
| 2 prefill top-1 vs decoded token | 0 / 57,475 tokens | 81 tokens in 63 questions (0.14%) | 0 / 57,387 |
| 3 continuation from 1/3, 2/3 cut | 0/400 differ | 131/400 differ | 0/400 |
| 4 max_num_seqs 256 -> 8, shuffled | 0/200 differ | 131/200 differ (9 answers) | 0/200 |

The control shows the checks are sensitive: without batch invariance, 4.5% of answers flip just
from changing the batch.

## 2. Exact screening, fp32 (adopted config)

| Version | Child acc. | \|A\|/\|P\| | median t\* | continuation decode saving | lemma 3 violations | flips outside D |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| parent (control) | 78.5% | 0 | - | - | 0 | 0 |
| Q8_0 | 79.0% | **0.478** | 94 | 66% | 0 | 0 |
| Q6_K | 80.0% | 0.873 | 29 | 26% | 0 | 0 |
| Q4_K_M | 74.0% | 1.000 | 0 | 5% | 0 | 0 |
| Q3_K_M | 41.5% | 1.000 | 0 | 0.5% | 0 | 0 |

|P| = 157. Rough 95% interval for Q8_0 |A|/|P|: 0.40 to 0.56.

## 3. Exact screening, bf16 (superseded, see DECISIONS.md D4)

| Version | \|A\|/\|P\| | median t\* | saving | tie positions |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| parent | 0 | - | - | 470 |
| Q8_0 | 0.717 | 65 | 49% | 453 |
| Q6_K | 0.918 | 30 | 25% | 431 |
| Q4_K_M | 0.994 | 0 | 5% | 401 |
| Q3_K_M | 1.000 | 0 | 0.5% | 509 |

## 4. Dequantization sanity (relative Frobenius error vs parent weights, median / max)

| Quant | BPW | bf16 dequant |
|---|---|---|
| Q8_0 | 8.50 | 0.57% / 0.96% |
| Q6_K | 6.56 | 1.8% / 2.9% |
| Q4_K_M | 4.99 | 2.9% / 8.7% |
| Q3_K_M | 4.11 | 7.2% / 16% |

## 5. Cost observations

- bf16 decode of 200 questions: 17 s (batch 256); prefill along parent outputs with top-1 logprobs: 3.5 s.
- fp32 decode: 26 s. fp32 prefill with top-20 logprobs (tie check): 12 s; needs re-measuring with small top-k.

## Not yet measured

End-to-end speedup (needs the audit design), full GSM8K (1,319) and MMLU-Pro, certificates and
coverage simulation, baselines, track B, perplexity check of the dequantized models.
